            <p>Hospitality professional turned Web Developer? Yep, that's me. Not counting 2 years as an SAP R/3 user and supply chain analyst, my career up to 2018 was spent mastering the restaurant industry managing teams from 3 to 100. Now I'm conquering new challenges in the world of code. May 2018 I began my junior developer position managing content for multiple corporate websites. I put my newly-acquired knowledge in HTML and CSS to work as I navigated my way through the Wordpress ecosystem. Now, equipped with Javascript, Python, and MySql I look forward to contributing as a full stack developer in my next role. On the personal side, I'm a self-admitted bandwagon-fan of MCU, GOT, and Modern Combat 5.</p>

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>Code is at the core of so much that I do. It's work, recreation, and my escape all in one. Early mornings and late nights are just part of the equation when it comes to building out my next project.</p>

            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>I've been so priveledged to not only attend Coding meetups, but to be the organizer for one as well. <a class="text-link" href="https://codeconnective.com/">Code Connective</a> is largely responsible for my first junior developer position so I feel it's only right to give back to what's given so much to me.</p>

            <p>What brings me joy? The thrill of talking about tech careers or teaching programming fundamentals to a group of young people. From the public school system to non-profits like <a class="text-link" href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a> and <a class="text-link" href="https://www.code-crew.org/">Code Crew</a>, anywhere I can touch a young life always feels great.</p>
